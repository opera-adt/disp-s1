    """Create a binary mask from the NISAR water distance mask with buffer zones.

    This function reads a water distance file, converts it to a binary mask
    with consideration for buffer zones, and writes the result to a new file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    water_distance_file : PathOrStr
        Path to the input water distance file.
    output_file : PathOrStr
        Path to save the output binary mask file.
    land_buffer : int, optional
        Buffer distance (in km) for land pixels. Only pixels this far or farther
        from water will be considered land. Default is 0.
    ocean_buffer : int, optional
        Buffer distance (in km) for ocean pixels. Only pixels this far or farther
        from land will be considered water. Default is 0.

    Notes
    -----
    Format of `water_distance_file` is UInt8, where:
    - 0 means "land"
    - 1 - 99 are ocean water pixels. The value is the distance (in km) to the shore.
      Value is rounded up to the nearest integer.
    - 100 - 200 are inland water pixels. Value is the distance to land.

    Output is a mask where 0 represents water pixels ("bad" pixels to ignore during
    processing/unwrapping), and 1 are land pixels to use.

    The buffer arguments make the masking more conservative. For example, a land_buffer
    of 2 means only pixels 2 km or farther from water will be masked as land. This helps
    account for potential changes in water levels.

    -----
    The function applies the following logic:
    - Starts with all pixels as land (True).
    - Masks inland water pixels as water (False) if they are farther from land
        than the land_buffer.
    - Masks ocean pixels as water (False) if they are farther from shore than
        `ocean_buffer`.
